# Mandarin Voice Style Transfer Demo

This repository demonstrates the Mandarin demo of CS679 voice style transfer project. 🐱 

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find several demos of Mandarin voice style transfer. Each demo includes the original voice file with one or more style-transferred versions of the same voice content. Wave files of all demos can be found in the [audio folder](audio/).

💜 **Mandarian voice dataset:** [Aishell](https://www.openslr.org/33/)\
💜 **English voice dataset:** [VCTK](https://huggingface.co/datasets/vctk)

❗All transferred audios were generated by [WaveNet](https://github.com/r9y9/wavenet_vocoder) vocoder, only for "two_old_friend", we have tried [Hifi-GAN](https://github.com/jik876/hifi-gan) as the vocoder, but applied it on the different base speakers (so please do not compare the voice features between wavenet transferred audio and hifi_GAN transferred audio in "two_old_friend" demo, speakers are not the same. 

## How to Use

To listen to the voice demos, **unmute** 🔉first and simply click on the play button of the embedded audio player under each section.
